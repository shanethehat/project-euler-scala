# Project Eular in Scala

In order to learn a bit of Scala I'm restarting the project Eular problems. Each problem must execute in under one minute.

## Running

The application uses SBT. To run a problem:

    sbt "run 01"

where `01` is the number of the problem to run. Leading zeros are required to match the numbering of the class names.
