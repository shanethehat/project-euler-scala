/**
 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:
 * 1^^2 + 2^^2 + ... + 10^^2 = 385
 *
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:
 * (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^^2 = 552 = 3025
 *
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 *
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
